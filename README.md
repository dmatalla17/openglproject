# openglproject
C++ MiniGW, OpenGL Project

In Module Three, you completed Final Project Milestone One, in which you proposed an object to develop in your final project. Now it is time to work directly on this 3D object and apply what you have learned in the course so far by creating a draft of your final project.

Please note that this draft is not meant to be complete. There are still aspects of the final project submission that you have not yet engaged in through the course materials, but you will soon do so in Module Six. In this milestone, however, you have the opportunity to apply your learning to date and produce an object with a sound basis in coding to carry forward as you complete the project and submit it in Module Seven.

Also, keep in mind that Milestone Two is a great opportunity to see not only what you know but where you may need help. Please use the Graphics Troubleshooting discussion topic as needed, and be sure to submit the assignment on time, even if you still have some areas to improve on.

To complete Milestone Two, you will submit commented code for the 3D object in the final project that aligns with some of the critical elements of the final project.
